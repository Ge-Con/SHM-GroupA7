Before running the code make sure that the .mat files "XP_PARAM" which are empty are deleted from the source files. We can alter the code so that it ignores them but for now i think it's fine like this.
For each PZT download you make, please rename it acoordingly to the campaign and e.g. "L1-03". The code takes the folder and creates another one with the adition of "CSV" in the name.
